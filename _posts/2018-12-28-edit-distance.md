Levenshtein distance between two strings
=====================

Levenshtein distance is a kind of edit distance, that is a way of quantifying of how dissimilar two strings are. It measure the minimum number of edits needed to transform the first string into the second string.

   |\psi_1\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle

$$
  a +b = c
